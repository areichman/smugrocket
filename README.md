# SmugRocket

A lightweight HTML5 client for SmugMug


## Build

The build process uses [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com).  Once Node is
installed on your system, install the grunt command-line tools and the app dependencies using the 
following commands:

npm install grunt-cli -g
npm install


## Deploy

The app is comprised entirely of HTML, CSS, and JS files.  So just build the project and then 
copy the dist directory to your favorite web server and you are off an running.


## Why SmugRocket?

Well, it's for SmugMug so that part should be obvious.  When I started writing this, my daughter
was a huge fan of Rocket from Disney's Little Einsteins, so I threw that into the mix.  Since I 
want the app to be blazing fast, it seemed like a good fit as well.
